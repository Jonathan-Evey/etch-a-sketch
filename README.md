# etch-a-sketch
Project made while working through The Odin Project curriculum.

Assignment details
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript (none hard coded in the HTML file).

2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. 

3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

(Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.

Notes: I changed the function for step three from a popup to giving a set number of grid options for the user.

for the color options I did not do a random value, but did a warm and cold color scale option.
